    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

   I introduce you to a simple code to generate matching "cards". The idea of this program started with my family tradition on Christmas Eve. In my family of 5, one person used to prepare 6 peaces of card with names of my family members and my dog (the 6th member of family) :) About 2 months before Christmas we used to draw those lots and the person you got the name of was the person you were going to buy a present for. This program is drawing the lots itself and prepare simple txt files titled by the name of person the card belongs to. If that peson opens the file he/she will see the name of a person, that is the lucky one to get the present on Christmas Eve.
